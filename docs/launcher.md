# App launcher & fuzzy match

`AppIndex.scan()` runs off-main, enumerates the user's search scopes, and dedups by bundle ID (the
earliest scope wins).

## Search scopes

`SearchScopes` (`Core/SearchScopes.swift`) owns the paths; the list is user-editable in General
Settings and persisted as `AppSettings.searchScopes`. A scope is either a directory or a single `.app`
bundle, stored tilde-abbreviated so the UI reads cleanly and a settings backup stays portable.

Enumeration is **flat** — one `contentsOfDirectory` per scope, no recursion. A nested folder such as
`/Applications/Adobe` is indexed by adding it as its own scope, which keeps the list honest: what it
shows is exactly what is scanned. (A one-level nested walk was measured against the flat list over the
real default set: same 96 apps, same ~0.5 ms once `Bundle()` metadata reads are counted.)

The defaults cover `/Applications` and `/System/Applications` plus their `Utilities` folders,
`/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications`, the cryptex apps under
`/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/App/System/Applications` (this is the only place Safari really
lives — `/Applications/Safari.app` is a symlink flagged hidden, so `.skipsHiddenFiles` never sees it),
`~/Applications`, and `/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app`.

Finder ships as an individual bundle scope rather than by adding `/System/Library/CoreServices`, which
holds ~120 background-agent bundles. There is no reliable way to filter those: `LSUIElement`,
`LSBackgroundOnly` and "declares no icon" each also exclude legitimately launchable apps — Raycast,
Stats, Tinycast itself, Mission Control, Siri, Time Machine, Screenshot, System Information, Font
Book. Don't reintroduce such a heuristic.

`AppIndex.start(settings:)` observes `$searchScopes`, so an edit re-indexes immediately; overlapping
refreshes collapse into a single trailing scan.

`FuzzyMatch.score` is a tiered scorer: exact → prefix → substring / word-start → subsequence with
consecutive / word-boundary bonuses. `LauncherRankingStore` then adds a bounded, query-specific
frecency boost (frequency plus decaying recency). The boost can reorder results within a relevance
tier but cannot make a weaker match kind beat a stronger one. Matching strips invisible Unicode
format scalars first, since app metadata can contain bidi/zero-width markers before the visible name.

Selecting a launcher result records every prefix of the submitted query, so choosing WhatsApp for
`wha` also teaches `w` and `wh`. Direct hotkeys and empty-query favorites do not affect learned
ranking. Learned data stays on device in `launcher-ranking.json`; a result that has learned ranking
offers a per-item reset in its Actions menu, and users can clear all learned ranking in General
Settings.

Rankings are memoized one query deep and keyed by the ranking store's revision, so a launch or reset
invalidates the cached order. `rank` resolves the whole learned table for a query up front via
`boosts(query:)` — one fold and one clock read per pass, not per candidate.

> **Invariant:** `Tools/fuzz-test.swift` contains a **copy** of `FuzzyMatch` from

> is meaningless.

The ranking harness covers prefix learning, frequency/recency scoring, persistence, and both reset
paths; see the command in `development.md`.

Icons go through a count-capped `NSCache` (`IconCache`).

## System commands

`CommandRegistry` exposes **Lock Screen** and **Sleep** alongside the other built-in commands. Both
hide the palette before dispatch. Sleep uses the public IOKit power-management API; Lock Screen posts
the standard macOS **⌃⌘Q** shortcut through CoreGraphics and requests event-posting access when
needed. Neither action shells out or relies on the removed `CGSession` helper.

Command entries use their stable `CommandID` for global-hotkey persistence, so commands can be
searched, favorited, hidden, or bound in Settings just like apps and System Settings panes.

## Quitting apps

`RunningAppsMonitor` (live from `NSWorkspace` launch/terminate notifications) drives both the row's
running dot and the availability of the quit actions:

- **Quit Application** — the last row of an app's ⌘K Actions menu, shown only while that app is
  running, also bound to **⌘↵** on the selected row. `AppLauncher.quit(bundleID:)` terminates every
  instance of the bundle and reports whether anything was running; the palette only dismisses when
  something was, and it restores focus unless the app it just quit *was* `previousApp`.
- **Quit All Applications** — a `CommandRegistry` command. `AppLauncher.quitAllTargets()` is the
  policy (every `.regular` app except Finder — `terminate()` only relaunches it — and Tinycast,
  excluded by PID because About/Settings temporarily flips it to `.regular`). `AppCore.quitAllApps()`
  resolves that list **once**, confirms it with an `NSAlert`, then terminates exactly what was
  confirmed. The palette hides before the alert — it is a floating panel and would sit above it.

Both quits are graceful `NSRunningApplication.terminate()`, so an app with unsaved work still puts up
its own save sheet.

The ⌘K menu samples `isRunning` **once, when it opens** (`RootPaletteView.openActions()`), so an app
launching or quitting elsewhere can't add or drop the Quit row while the menu is up — the same freeze
the rest of the menu already has ([palette.md](palette.md)). Only `LauncherList` observes
`RunningAppsMonitor` live, for the running dot.
